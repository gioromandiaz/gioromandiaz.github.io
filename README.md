I'm still alive, lots of great things have happened recently, I'm currently employed at IBM working as a technical specialist for the Hybrid Cloud portfolio, within the Storage platform.
The people I work with are awesome, they're very supportive and there is a lot to learn, and I haven't been this excited in a long time.
I'll try to update this site as much as possible, but a lot of new projects I have in mind will work their way through my GitHub repo's.

Soon... maybe. I'm admittedly bad with setting time aside for things like this.

Sadly, still no update. But I do plan on having a couple of things up on here. One of them being a blog-like page where I can dump all of the things that would be blog-appropriate lol.

Nothing on here yet, but hopefully soon I'll be able to add more stuff here. :)
